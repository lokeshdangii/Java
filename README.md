# Java

Welcome to my Java Repository! This repository documents my journey in learning and understanding the Java programming language. This repository serves as a showcase of my understanding of various Java concepts and problem-solving techniques.Here, I have organized my Java programs into different folders based on the topics and concepts I've explored.

## Topics Covered:

- **[01_Variables and Data Types:](https://github.com/lokeshdangii/Java/tree/main/01_Variables%20and%20Data%20types)** Programs covering variables and data types in Java.
- **[02_Conditional Statements:](https://github.com/lokeshdangii/Java/tree/main/02_Conditional%20Statements)** Programs demonstrating conditional constructs (if, else if, switch).
- **[03_Operators:](https://github.com/lokeshdangii/Java/tree/main/03_Operators)** Programs exploring various operators in Java (arithmetic, - relational, logical, bitwise).
- **[04_Loops:](https://github.com/lokeshdangii/Java/tree/main/04_Loops)** Programs utilizing different loop constructs (for, while, do-while).
- **[05_pattern_practice:](https://github.com/lokeshdangii/Java/tree/main/05_pattern_practice)** Practice programs for pattern printing challenges.
- **[05_patterns:](https://github.com/lokeshdangii/Java/tree/main/05_patterns)** More complex pattern printing programs.
- **[06_Functions:](https://github.com/lokeshdangii/Java/tree/main/06_Functions)** Programs showcasing the use of functions (methods) in Java.
- **[07_Arrays:](https://github.com/lokeshdangii/Java/tree/main/07_Arrays)** Programs related to arrays (creation, manipulation, common operations).
- **[08_Basic Sorting Algorithms:](https://github.com/lokeshdangii/Java/tree/main/07_Arrays)** Implementations of basic sorting algorithms.
- **[09_2D Array:](https://github.com/lokeshdangii/Java/tree/main/09_2D%20Array)** Programs involving two-dimensional arrays (matrices).
- **[10_String:](https://github.com/lokeshdangii/Java/tree/main/10_String)** Programs focusing on string manipulation in Java.
- **[11_Bit Manipulation:](https://github.com/lokeshdangii/Java/tree/main/10_String/Bit%20Manipulation)** Programs demonstrating bit manipulation techniques.

**NOTE : There are some basic problems in each folder which are for the practice purpose of that topic.**


## Explore Programs/Problems

To explore the programs from this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:-
   
       git clone https://github.com/lokeshdangii/Java.git
       
3. Navigate to the cloned Java directory:-

       cd Path_to_Java/Java
     
5. Compile the Java file:-

       javac <filename.java>
   
7. Now run the Java file with

       java <filename>


You can examine the problems and programs, modify them, and experiment with them according to your approach.

## Prerequisite 

To run the Java Programs in your local system **Java Development Kit(JDK)** must be installed in your local system, you can download and install JDK as per your system type ( [Windows](https://download.oracle.com/java/20/latest/jdk-20_windows-x64_bin.exe (sha256)) , [Linux](https://download.oracle.com/java/20/latest/jdk-20_linux-x64_bin.deb (sha256)) , [Mac](https://download.oracle.com/java/20/latest/jdk-20_macos-aarch64_bin.dmg (sha256))).
